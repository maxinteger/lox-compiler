# CHALLENGES

## 1) Line number - DONE
Our encoding of line information is hilariously wasteful of memory. Given that a series of instructions often correspond to the same source line, a natural solution is something akin to run-length encoding of the line numbers.

Devise an encoding that compresses the line information for a series of instructions on the same line. Change writeChunk() to write this compressed form, and implement a getLine() function that, given the index of an instruction, determines the line where the instruction occurs.

Hint: It’s not necessary for getLine() to be particularly efficient. Since it is only called when a runtime error occurs, it is well off the critical path where performance matters.


## 2) Extend constants

Because OP_CONSTANT only uses a single byte for its operand, a chunk may only contain up to 256 different constants. That’s small enough that people writing real-world code will hit that limit. We could use two or more bytes to store the operand, but that makes every constant instruction take up more space. Most chunks won’t need that many unique constants, so that wastes space and sacrifices some locality in the common case to support the rare case.

To balance those two competing aims, many instruction sets feature multiple instructions that perform the same operation but with operands of different sizes. Leave our existing one-byte OP_CONSTANT instruction alone, and define a second OP_CONSTANT_LONG instruction. It stores the operand as a 24-bit number, which should be plenty.

Implement this function:

void writeConstant(Chunk* chunk, Value value, int line) {
  // Implement me...
}
It adds value to chunk’s constant array and then writes an appropriate instruction to load the constant. Also add support to the disassembler for OP_CONSTANT_LONG instructions.

Defining two instructions seems to be the best of both worlds. What sacrifices, if any, does it force on us?

## 3) Memory allocation

Our reallocate() function relies on the C standard library for dynamic memory allocation and freeing. malloc() and free() aren’t magic. Find a couple of open source implementations of them and explain how they work. How do they keep track of which bytes are allocated and which are free? What is required to allocate a block of memory? Free it? How do they make that efficient? What do they do about fragmentation?

Hardcore mode: Implement reallocate() without calling realloc(), malloc(), or free(). You are allowed to call malloc() once, at the beginning of the interpreter’s execution, to allocate a single big block of memory which your reallocate() function has access to. It parcels out blobs of memory from that single region, your own personal heap. It’s your job to define how it does that.
